## Getting started

### Clone the repo

After you [added an ssh key](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) to your GitHub account:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:optimistic-data-spirit/dengai.git
```

Note that the data and its sub-folders are omitted from this repo so you will have to locally create them on your own. The command to do this is: 
```bash
mkdir -p data/{external,interim,processed,raw}
```

### Download the data
Download the [data](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/data/) and save locally in you `data/raw` folder without changing the file name.

### Create the training dataset
```bash
make data
```
